### Cambodia and Thailand clinch ceasefire after deadly Preah Vihear clashes
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and his Thai counterpart Srettha Thavisin signed a joint communiqu√© on Sept. 12 in Phnom Penh to halt cross-border fire after two days of intense shelling near the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both sides will:

- Withdraw all forces 5 km from the disputed boundary  
- Resume ‚Äúprecondition-free‚Äù diplomatic talks under UN and ASEAN auspices  
- Reconvene next month in Bangkok to solidify a lasting settlement  

Cambodia‚Äôs defence ministry reports four soldiers killed and 15 wounded; Thailand confirms three fatalities and 12 injuries. Thousands of villagers fled Ban Paknam and Chong Srey, prompting UNHCR to assess shelter needs for some 2,000 displaced civilians. Experts warn deep-rooted nationalism and resource-rights disputes may spark future flashpoints if not addressed by the planned joint border commission.

## üéØ Editor's Analysis
**Key Themes Today:**  
- Regional diplomacy in action: ASEAN and UN step in to broker and monitor peace

**What This Means:**  
The swift ceasefire underscores how rising geopolitical risks in Southeast Asia are increasingly managed through multilateral frameworks.
