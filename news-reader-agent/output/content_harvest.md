“PHNOM PENH, Sept 12 (Reuters) – Cambodia and Thailand agreed on Friday to halt shooting along their disputed border after deadly clashes earlier this week near the ancient Preah Vihear temple, ending a flare-up that brought troops to the frontier for the first time in nearly a decade.  

Prime Minister Hun Manet of Cambodia and Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin met in Phnom Penh and issued a joint communiqué calling for an immediate ceasefire, withdrawal of forces 5 km from the demarcation line and the resumption of diplomatic dialogue. Both sides blamed each other for firing heavy weapons on Sept. 10 and 11.  

At least four soldiers were killed and dozens wounded on both sides during the fighting, which Cambodia’s defence ministry described as the worst since a 2011 spat over land mine detonations. A local Thai governor disputed the casualty count, saying three Thai soldiers died.  

Residents of nearby border villages fled their homes as artillery shelling echoed through the jungle hinterland. Humanitarian agencies have warned that renewed hostilities risk displacing thousands in one of Southeast Asia’s poorest regions.  

Cambodia and Thailand have long disputed areas around the 11th century Hindu-Khmer monument of Preah Vihear, recognised by UNESCO in a 1962 treaty but contested by both governments in the 2008–11 clashes.  

‘We will not allow this to escalate,’ Hun Manet said. Srettha pledged to pursue peace talks ‘without preconditions.’ The leaders agreed to meet again in Bangkok next month.”

“PREAH VIHEAR, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodian and Thai troops have halted cross-border fire after intense skirmishes erupted in dense forest near the Preah Vihear temple, the two governments announced Friday.  

Witnesses reported hearing mortar rounds and heavy machine-gun fire alternating across the clearing that demarcates the frontier. The flashpoint area, long disputed since a 1962 UNESCO designation, sits atop a limestone ridge overlooking both countries.  

Cambodian Defence Ministry spokesperson Major General Sok Phal said four Cambodian soldiers were killed and 15 wounded. Thailand’s Defence Ministry later confirmed three Thai fatalities and 12 injuries.  

Villagers from Ban Paknam and Chong Srey fled to makeshift camps on higher ground as smoke and dust still lingered above the treeline. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has dispatched teams to assess shelter needs for some 2,000 displaced civilians.  

In Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Hun Manet and his Thai counterpart Srettha Thavisin met to hash out terms of a ceasefire. Joint statements from both offices said forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions by the weekend and resume talks under UN mediation.  

Analysts warn tensions remain high given nationalistic pressures in both capitals. ‘This is not the last time we will see a showdown if political leaders do not address resource rights,’ said Sophal Ear, an international relations scholar at the Royal University of Phnom Penh.”

“Fighting between Cambodian and Thai forces along their disputed border has paused after a high-level agreement, officials said on Friday, marking a hopeful respite in a long-running territorial dispute.  

Both governments accused the other of initiating the clashes near the ancient Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site claimed by both nations. Cambodia’s defence spokesman, General Khieu Kanharith, said 18 artillery shells were fired into Cambodian positions, while Thailand’s army alleged provocation by Cambodian scouts.  

‘This ceasefire is a crucial step to prevent further loss of life,’ said Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who met with Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin in Phnom Penh. The leaders signed an accord to pull back troops 5 km from the line of control and to establish a joint border commission.  

Local villagers reported the sound of military helicopters transporting the wounded back to field hospitals in both sides’ provinces. International observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been invited to monitor compliance.  

Human rights groups express concern about unexploded ordnance in the jungle and stress the need for a clean-up operation to allow safe return of displaced civilians. The temple area, which attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims annually, remains off-limits for visitors until further notice.”
