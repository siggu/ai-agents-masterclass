Executive Summary
- As of mid-2024: SMRs/microreactors progressing toward first commercial ops (NuScale, Rolls-Royce, US DOE microreactor demos); advanced fission demos (Natrium, molten salt pilots) in prototype/permit phases; fusion achieved energy milestones in experiments but commercial timeline ~2030s-2040s. Main insight: commercialization accelerating but constrained by supply chains, licensing, financing and fuel/waste policy.

Background & Current State
- SMRs: licensing templates, first builds planned in US/UK/ROW. Microreactors: DOE demos funded.
- Advanced fission: TerraPower Natrium paused/reshaped; MSR testbeds. Fast reactors active in China, Russia, India.
- Fusion: ITER construction progressing; private firms (CFS, Helion) advancing demonstration devices.
- Fuel cycle: HALEU supply expanding slowly; recycling pilots limited. Public support rising modestly.

Analysis & Insights
- Trends: modularization, non-electric markets (hydrogen, heat), private capital in fusion, national strategic push.
- Barriers: financing, manufacturing scale-up, regulatory harmonization, proliferation/safeguards for advanced fuels.
- Expert view: near-term gains from SMRs and microreactors; long-term potential for advanced fission and fusion.

Future Outlook
- 2025-2035: first SMRs commercially online; HALEU capacity growth; growing industrial heat/hydrogen demos.
- 2030s-2040s: possible commercial advanced fission fleets; fusion pilot plants mid-2030s, commercialization later.
- Implications: policy to de-risk finance, bolster supply chains, strengthen safeguards/export controls.
