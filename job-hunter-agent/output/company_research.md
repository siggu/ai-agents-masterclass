# Role Context and Product Involvement
As a **Senior Backend (Go) Developer**, you will sit on the Data Analytics team that owns the core microservices powering:  
- **Data Ingestion Pipelines:** Kafka-based stream processors that normalize and route data.  
- **Analytics Engines:** Go services querying Elasticsearch clusters for fast aggregations.  
- **Real-Time API Layer:** High-performance endpoints serving customer dashboards and alerts.  

Team structure typically includes:  
- 2–3 Backend Engineers (Go and Java)  
- 1 Data Engineer (Kafka & ETL)  
- 1 DevOps Engineer (Kubernetes, CI/CD)  
- A Product Manager and QA/Testing specialist  

You’ll collaborate closely with customer-facing Data Scientists and DevOps to ensure your microservices meet SLAs and support scaling to millions of events per hour.
