## Concepts To Know/Review
- Go concurrency patterns (worker pools, channels, context cancellation)  
- Go memory management & GC tuning  
- Microservices design: service boundaries, API versioning, scalability  
- Kafka internals: partitioning, consumer groups, delivery guarantees  
- Elasticsearch: index design, sharding, replica strategies, query performance  
- Distributed reliability: circuit breakers, retries, idempotency  
- Observability: Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry, structured logging  
- CI/CD best practices: Docker, Kubernetes manifests, blue/green and canary deployments

## Strategic Advice
- **Tone & Focus:** Be confident in your backend fundamentals. Emphasize your quick learning curve for Go and passion for performance.
